**<span style="color: red">The templates changed on Mar 11 because of the upgrade to TF 2.0.0a0,
be sure to use the updated ones when submitting!</span>**

In order to familiarize with TensorFlow and TensorBoard, start by playing with
[example_keras_tensorboard.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl114/tree/master/labs/01/example_keras_tensorboard.py).
Run it, and when it finishes, run TensorBoard using `tensorboard --logdir logs`.
Then open <http://localhost:6006> in a browser and explore the active tabs.

Your goal is to modify the
[mnist_layers_activations.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl114/tree/master/labs/01/mnist_layers_activations.py)
template and implement the following:
- A number of hidden layers (including zero) can be specified on the command line
  using parameter `layers`.
- Activation function of these hidden layers can be also specified as a command
  line parameter `activation`, with supported values of `none`, `relu`, `tanh`
  and `sigmoid`.
- Print the final accuracy on the test set.

In addition to submitting the task in ReCodEx, please also run the following
variations and observe the results in TensorBoard:
- `0` layers, activation `none`
- `1` layer, activation `none`, `relu`, `tanh`, `sigmoid`
- `10` layers, activation `sigmoid`, `relu`
